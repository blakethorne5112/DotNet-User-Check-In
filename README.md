# .NET User Check In System
Logic written in C#. Credits to Blake, Josh and Sebastian.

## How does it work?
The .NET User Check in System lets you check in and check out of a location. This type of system allows for people to keep track of who's visiting an office, for example. 
All information provided at check in and check out is stored in a database that can be viewed by staff with a staff login.
See the below screenshots for some wireframes!
